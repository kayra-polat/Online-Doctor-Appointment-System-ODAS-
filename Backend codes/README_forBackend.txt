***HOW TO RUN OUR BACKEND PROJECT***

In our backend codes, there is a "scripts" file which is used for creating our database tables with SQL scripts.

- First, you must install "go" language. 
- Second, you must write "go mod tidy" command in the project root directory.
- Third, you must run "go build main.go" command in the project root directory.
- Finally, you can run "main.exe".
